### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software architecture enthusiast; I enjoy optimizing the design of even the simplest of systems to reduce redundancies and enable proper separation of concerns; and hyperfocused on reusability. Now, I am bringing that enthusiasm to large language models and computational social science.
A perennial student at the crossroads of machine learning and software engineering, I have always been particularly drawn to self-sustainability as a key tenet of software engineering. I experienced life as a software engineer starting from my BS/MS at the Rochester Institute of Technology followed by working as a Full-Stack Developer when I transitioned to working on my Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing for Social Good.
